### em-dragons

The main command is `cargo unleash em-dragons`, here is its help. All subcommands have extensive `--help` for you.

```bash
$ cargo-unleash em-dragons --help
Unleash ‚Äôem dragons

Package all selected crates, check them and attempt to publish them.

USAGE:
    cargo-unleash em-dragons [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
        --build
            Actually build the package in check

            By default, this only runs `cargo check` against the package build. Set this flag to have it run an actual
            `build` instead.
        --check-readme
            Generate & verify whether the Readme file has changed.

            When enabled, this will generate a Readme file from the crate‚Äôs doc comments (using cargo-readme), and check
            whether the existing Readme (if any) matches.
        --dry-run
            dry run

        --empty-is-failure
            Consider no package matching the criteria an error

    -h, --help
            Prints help information

        --ignore-publish
            Ignore whether `publish` is set.

            If nothing else is specified, `publish = true` is assumed for every package. If publish is set to false or
            any registry, it is ignored by default. If you want to include it regardless, set this flag.
        --include-dev-deps
            Do not disable dev-dependencies

            By default we disable dev-dependencies before the run.
        --include-pre-deps
            Even if not selected by default, also include depedencies with a pre (cascading)

        --no-check
            dry run

    -V, --version
            Prints version information


OPTIONS:
        --owner <add-owner>
            Ensure we have the owner set as well

    -c, --changed-since <changed-since>
            Automatically detect the packages, which changed compared to the given git commit.

            Compares the current git `head` to the reference given, identifies which files changed and attempts to
            identify the packages and its dependents through that mechanism. You can use any `tag`, `branch` or
            `commit`, but you must be sure it is available (and up to date) locally.
    -i, --ignore-pre-version <ignore-pre-version>...
            Ignore version pre-releases

            Skip if the SemVer pre-release field is any of the listed. Mutually exclusive with `--package`
    -p, --packages <packages>...
            Only use the specfic set of packages

            Apply only to the packages named as defined. This is mutually exclusive with skip and ignore-version-pre.
    -s, --skip <skip>...
            Skip the package names matching ...

            Provide one or many regular expression that, if the package name matches, means we skip that package.
            Mutually exclusive with `--package`
        --token <token>
            the crates.io token to use for uploading

            If this is nor the environment variable are set, this falls back to the default value provided in the user
            directory [env: CRATES_TOKEN]
```

## Common Usage Examples

**Release all crates** not having the `-dev`-pre version set
```bash
cargo-unleash em-dragons --ignore-pre-version dev
```

**Check if a PR can be released** (checking only changes in the PR compared to `main`)
```bash
cargo-unleash check --changed-since=main
```

**Release all crates** not having `test` in the name
```bash
cargo-unleash em-dragons --skip test
```

**Set the pre-version to `-dev`**
```bash
cargo-unleash version set-pre dev
```

**Bump the pre-version**, so for e.g. from `alpha.1` to `alpha.2` or `beta.3` to `beta.4`:
```bash
cargo-unleash version bump-pre
```
